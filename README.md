Solutions to problems I could solve :P

<1> Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
    For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
    Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

<2> Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers     in the original array except the one at i.
    For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the       expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
    Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

<4> Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the         lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.
    For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.
    You can modify the input array in-place.

<58> Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods:      enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.

<61> Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.
     Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.
     For example, pow(2, 10) should return 1024.
    
<68> On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another        bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces. You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples        on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair        doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).
     You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.
   
<69>. Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.
      For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
      You can assume the list has at least three integers.
    
<70>. A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10. Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.
      For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.
    
<71>. Using a function rand7() that returns an integer from 1 to 7 (inclusive) with uniform probability, implement a function rand5()         that returns an integer from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

<73>. Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse it in-place

<75>. Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not                 necessarily have to be contiguous.
      For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence has 
      length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

<76>. You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that       each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go       down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

<78>. Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one sorted singly linked list.
